- 👋 Hi there! My name is Hunter Schiers (aka @GunterCodes). I am currently trying to transition out of the health/fitness field into technology. The journey definitely won't be easy, but I hope to learn the tools and find a company where I can use my background knowledge and passion for learning in order to grow with the business.  
- 👀 I’m interested in ... Data Science/Analytics and App Development
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... Python, HTML/CSS, and Javascript
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... any projects possible! I am looking for as much code exposure as I can manage in order to explore the various aspects of coding in order to find my place in the field.
- 📫 Reach me via email at: hschiers3@gmail.com
